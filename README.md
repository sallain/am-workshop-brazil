## Schedule

Until 9:45 we'll talk about ourselves and the company that we work for,
Artefactual Systems Inc. Then we'll have a 15 minute break before we talk about
Archivematica. The Archivematica 101 session will cover the history of the project,
current status, upcoming features and wishlist. I will also demo Archivematica for you so that you can see how it works in practice.

After lunch, Dan will present AtoM 101. Again, he'll look at the history of the
project, current status, upcoming features and wishlist, and then do a demo of
AtoM. Following an afternoon coffee break, we will then present some use cases,
looking at how Archivematica and AtoM are used around the world and in many
different types of institutions.

During the presentations, please ask questions at any time - just raise a hand. We
will also leave plenty of time at the end for questions and discussion.
